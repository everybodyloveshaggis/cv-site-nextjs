        <span className='font-semibold'>Early Career and Software Development</span><br />
        In 2017, I embarked on my IT adventure as a junior software engineer. My days were filled with coding ASP.NET applications, where I dabbled in technologies like C#, HTML, JavaScript, XSLT, and T-SQL. But my role extended beyond mere coding. As part of a small yet dynamic technical team, I found myself triaging and resolving IT-related tickets and service requests. The experience was invaluable, and I also took charge of deployment managementâ€”both for physical servers and virtual environments (think Windows Server and Hyper-V). Cybersecurity and backup procedures became second nature to me during this phase.

        <span className='font-semibold'>Later Roles and Diverse Technology Exposure</span><br />
        Fast forward a year, and I stepped into a new chapter: an Application Support / 3rd Line Service Desk role within another public sector organization. Here, my tech toolkit expanded exponentially. I immersed myself in a diverse array of software technologies, including Java (Spring framework, JSF, Thymeleaf), Drools, Red Hat BRMS, Red Hat Process Automation Manager, Express JS, Angular, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. But it wasnâ€™t just about software; I also delved into server-side technologies like Apache HTTPD, RHEL, JBoss EAP, JBoss Portal, JBoss Fuse, IIS, and AMQ. Tools like SonarQube, Snyk, Travis-CI, and Jenkins became my trusted companions. And letâ€™s not forget my affinity for testing technologiesâ€”JMeter and UiPath. Containerization? Yep, I mastered both Podman and Docker. But my current role as a DevOps Engineer takes the cake. Iâ€™m all about Site Reliability Engineering, deploying and maintaining tools like Dynatrace, crafting alerting systems, and even building bespoke solutions using Java and React. Itâ€™s been quite the journeyâ€”a blend of software development, server administration, and cutting-edge DevOps practices. ðŸš€
